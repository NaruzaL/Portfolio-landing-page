            <br>
            <p><strong>A little bit about why I chose to learn programming</strong></p>
            <p>I've always had an interest in computers. In the last 15 years I've built 3 of my own. December of 2016 I put together a PC using my old case and power supply. I upgraded my 7 year old rig to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>a watercooled i5 6600K processor</li>
              <li>a Z170 Gigabyte motherboard</li>
              <li>a Geforce 1070 graphics card</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Yes, I like to play my games on ultra settings.</em></p>
            <p>My interest in computer hardware led to a natural interest in programming and so I've ended up here at Epicodus to obtain the skills and knowledge to make my dream of working with computers in some way, shape or form a reality.</p>

            <br>
            <p>I was born in Portland, OR in 1981 and have lived in Oregon all of my life. I went to Ardenwald elementary school, Milwaukie Junior High School, LaSalle College Prep, and Oregon State University where I obtained a BS in liberal studies focusing on New Media Communication. After college I moved back to Portland and started a job as a registrar in the Emergency Department at Providence St. Vincent Medical Center. I was employed there for 6 years and finally decided to leave because of the depressing atmosphere of working in an ED. From there I moved to be a chauffuer at Aspen Limo Tours. Driving limousines was fun and could pay extremely well but the hours were too sporadic and so I ended up leaving that job to become a caregiver for my uncle who was having heath problems at the time. Fast foreward a couple years and now I'm here at Epicodus learning how to make awesome webpages like the one you're reading right now. </p>

          <br>
          <p>In my mind I've always been the type of guy who's good at everything but master of nothing. I've dabbled in a little bit of everthing just to see if it interests me. In my youth it was athletics. Namely football, baseball and basketball. As I've gotten older my focus has changed. If I had to list my hobbies now, let's say most frequently partaken to least, the list would look something like:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Playing my guitar</li>
            <li>Board games and card games</li>
            <li>Reading (mostly fantasy)</li>
            <li>PC gaming</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Most of what I do now is practice programming but it's not really a hobby, it's becoming more of a passion.</p>
